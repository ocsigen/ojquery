# jQuery Binding

This a binding of the jQuery library, using **goji** by Benjamin CANOU.

This library is not over yet, and the interface WILL change in the future. 
You are however free to use it if writing deprecated code is your thing.

## Usage

Compile your project with the package ojquery. Yep, that's all. You can use it now.

## Known Issues

Most of the typing is not done. If the signature of the function seems correct 
to you, I guess you can use it. You might be able to still use some "undone" 
functions (using JavaScript.Inject), but there is no guarantee
at all, and you're on your own. I'm not even sure it'll work with 
JavaScript.Inject actually. Anyway, good luck.
